I have some quistions on details of this assignement:
1-1. newline after exit
it looks like in some instances my program prints a newline after exit,
% exit

(program exits)
unlike the ./sampleish. but not always.
% exit
(program exits)
is this okay? or do I have to fix it? Because it looks like the outcomes are different machine by machine

1-2. list of allowed libraries.
I did upload my list of libraries in the past which got confirmed. But i am also using more libraries now. Is it okay to use all builtin GNU libraries?

I also have some questions on ./sampleish behaviour (especially on aliasing):
2-1. redirect: redirection non-restore
consider the following commands run in ./sampleish. Here, ./prog is a prgram that prints [0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9]
% ./_prog > out_test
(% sign vanishes, and the following 3 lines are my input)
./_prog
echo ee209
exit
in the [out_test] file:
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 
% 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 
% ee209
% 
it looks like after a redirection out, the stdout of the shell itself is redirected to the new redirection file. Is this an error? Or do we implment this?

2-2. redirect: pre-mature exit on redirection error
consider the following commands run in ./sampleish. Here, all directories are non-existent, meaing that the ./sampleish must "gracefully" return.
% dummy > out_dummy
dummy: No such file or directory
(an empty file [out_dummy] created)
(as explained 2-1, the % sign vanishes)
dummy < in_dummy
./sampleish: No such file or directory
(./sampleish exits by itself)
As seen above, ./sampleish just exits by itself. Is this an error? Or do we implment this?

2-3. alias: single quoting
I can't seem to find a good explanation for the behaviour of alias single quoting. Here are some things I have tried:

% alias name=cmd
% alias           
alias name='cmd'
% alias name'='cmd
% alias
alias name='cmd'
% alias name'=''cmd'
% alias
alias name='cmd'
% alias 'na'me'=cmd'
% alias
alias name='cmd'
% alias '''''name'''''=cmd
% alias
alias name='cmd'
% alias name='cmd
./sampleish: Could not find quote pair
% alias name='c'mcd'c'
% alias
alias name='cmcdc'
% alias name='cmd''
./sampleish: Could not find quote pair
% alias name='c md'
% alias
alias name='c md'
% alias name='c' 'md'
./sampleish: alias takes one parameter
% alias name='c'' md'
% alias
alias name='c md'
% alias na' me'='c'' md'
% alias
alias name='c md'
alias na me='c md'

please, can you elaborate more on the required behaviours for alias? the current specification is too ambiguous to implement.

2-4. alias: single and double quoting
This gets even more confusing when double quotes are added

% alias na"me="'cmd'
% alias
alias name='cmd'
% alias name"=cmd'"
% alias
alias name='cmd''
% alias na"me=''cmd'''''"
% alias
alias name='''cmd''''''
% alias name='cm"d'"
./sampleish: Could not find quote pair
% alias name="cmd'''"""
% alias
alias name='cmd''''
% alias "name='"'cm''d'
% alias
alias name=''cmd'

so, do we have to replicate all of this behavour? or can we just assume that the format of alias is fixed as:
alias AliasName='command -arguments'

Thanks.
