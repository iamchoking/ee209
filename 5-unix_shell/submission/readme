1.1. Parnter Name and ID / Description of Work Division
This submission was constructed entirely alone.

2. Description of Recieved Help
This submission recieved no direct help.

3. Indication of Time Spent
This project took about 3 days, with approximately 30 to 40 hours of coding.

4. Assessment
Everyone wants to make a unix shell. The redirection and the alias part was much harder than I expected. But I had a blast making it.
But the provided sample files had some bugs. I hope that they could be addressed as well.

5. Information to Help on Grading
this submission of simple unix shell was developed with a debug option.
This has tremendously helped development, and the author is confident that this will help the grading process as well.
>>run the program with a [-d] argument to run it in debug mode.
=============================================
./ish -d
=============================================
this will outline, in pretty detail, what the program is doing (along with peripheral clues like current directory and pid)
Below is an example.

NORMAL mode [./ish]

--------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------
$./ish
% alias a="echo"
% a ee209 assignment 5
ee209 assignment 5
%exit
--------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------


DEBUG mode [./ish -d]
(in DEBUG mode, the [PID|cwd] is printed before %)
(the process of LEX->ALIAS-PREPROCESS->SYN->EXEC is outlined)
